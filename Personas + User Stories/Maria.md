**Name:** Maria Marques 
**Age:** 20
**Occupation:** University Student  
**Location:** Viseu, Portugal

## Background  
Maria studies Biology at the University of Aveiro, living there during the week and going home for the weekend. She really enjoys playing the card game "Sueca" with her friends during the free hours in her schedule.  

## Daily Life  
Maria lives a normal university student's life, going to class after her morning routine, studying for her exams, going out and partying every once in a while. However, her favorite moments are when she spends with her friends playing the card game "Sueca", even going to tournaments when they see fit. In the current semester, the four of them happened to get slotted into mostly different classes, making it so their schedules almost never fully match up. This causes them to not be able to play "Sueca" due to the lack of a fourth player. 

## Goals & Needs    
Find a fourth player to be able to play "Sueca" with her friends even though their schedules don't allow four of them to meet up very often. 

## Pain Points & Challenges    
Most Sueca apps only allow AI opponents in fully virtual games, removing the social aspect she values. Worse yet, those features are often locked behind paywalls, making them inconvenient for casual players. 

## Motivation  
Be able to play "Sueca" with her friends during the week even though their schedules are not the best in that regard.
