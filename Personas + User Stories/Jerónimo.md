**Name:** Jerónimo Jesus 
**Age:** 41  
**Occupation:** Office worker  
**Location:** São Paulo, Brasil

## Background  
    Jerónimo lives with his wife and kid and works at an office for a tech company. He enjoys playing card games with his friends, in specific the game "Sueca". 

## Daily Life  
    Jerónimo's daily work life is simple, he has his morning routine, then goes to work at the office and goes home after his shift ends. He is a very big fan of the card game "Sueca" though, and really enjoys playing with his friends during his friends at work during their lunch break or even after their shift ends, sometimes playing for hours on end. Recently, he moved houses to a different city, which also caused him to move offices, and can no longer play with his friends in person, but feels like playing online on one of the available websites or apps with his friends who are now far away does not capture the same feeling that having the cards on the table did.

## Goals & Needs    
    He is looking for a way to play "Sueca" with his friends remotely while keeping the same spirit and vibe of playing it with physical cards.

## Pain Points & Challenges    
    Most existing apps offer purely virtual gameplay that doesn’t capture the feeling of playing with real cards and friends around the table. The social aspect and physical cues that make the game fun are missing. 

## Motivation  
    Jerónimo wants to stay in touch with his friends and keep their Sueca games alive, maintaining the same friendly atmosphere they had when playing together in person.
