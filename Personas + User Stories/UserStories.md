### Use AI Players in a Physical Sueca Game
    Priority: High
    Estimate: 18 Story Points
    As a user,
    I want to integrate AI players into a real, physical Sueca match,
    so that I can enjoy a full game even when there aren’t enough human players and maintain fair play through AI arbitration.

    Given that I’m setting up a physical Sueca game with real cards,
    When I choose to activate AI players in the app and show their dealt cards using a camera or manual input,
    Then the AI players should be able to make decisions and play according to the standard Sueca rules.

    Given that I'm hosting an online lobby or table in the app,
