**Name:** Jerónimo 
**Age:** 41  
**Occupation:** Office worker  
**Location:** São Paulo, Brasil

## Background  
Average office worker

## Daily Life  
Jerónimo's daily work life is simple, he has his morning routine, then goes to work at the office and goes home after his shift ends. He is a very big fan of the card game "Sueca" though, and really enjoys playing with his friends during his friends at work during their lunch break or even after their shift ends, sometimes playing for hours on end. Recently, he moved houses to a different city and can no longer play with his friends in person, but feels like playing online on one of the available websites or apps with his friends who are now far away does not capture the same feeling that having the cards on the table did.

## Goals & Needs    
He is looking for a way to play "Sueca" with his friends remotely while keeping the same spirit and vibe of playing it with physical cards.

## Pain Points & Challenges    
All of the currently available apps use a completely virtual approaches and online only play, not supporting the way of playing that he and his friends most enjoy.

## Motivation  
He wants to keep regular contact with his friends and keep the games of "Sueca" going with the rest of the group while maitaining the same enviroment it usually brought.
